Deploying a three-tier application on Kubernetes involves dividing your system into three distinct parts:

1. **Presentation Layer (Tier 1)**: This is what users see when they visit your website. Itâ€™s the interface that users interact with directly.

2. **Logical Layer (Tier 2)**: Think of this layer as the brain behind the scenes. It processes the information provided through the user interface according to the system's rules. For example, on a shopping website, this layer calculates the total price of items, applies discounts, and checks stock availability.

3. **Data Layer (Tier 3)**: This layer is responsible for storing and retrieving data. It acts as the system's memory, managing and storing information needed by the system. Data can be stored in databases, files, or other storage systems.

## Steps to Complete This Task

**Stage 1**: Set Up EC2 and IAM User  
- Create an IAM User.
- Attach policies directly to the IAM User, providing administrator access.
- Click on the IAM User, go to Security Credentials.
- Scroll down, click on Access Keys, and create new access keys.
- Choose AWS CLI from the options listed.
- Download the CSV file containing your username and password or copy them to your notepad.

### Next Steps:

A. Launch your EC2 instance where all the tasks will be performed:
   - Connect to your EC2 instance and run the following commands:
     ```bash
     sudo su
     apt update
     mkdir 3-tier # You can change the directory name as desired
     cd 3-tier
     ```
B. Fetch the code from GitHub by cloning the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aakibgithuber/Three-tier-Application-Deployment-.git
   ```

- Run `ls` to view the contents of the repository.

C. The next step is to set up AWS CLI, Docker, Kubectl, and Eksctl.

**AWS CLI (Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface)** allows us to interact with AWS services using commands.

- Run this command to install AWS CLI:
  ```bash
  snap install aws-cli --classic
  ```

- Configure AWS CLI:
  ```bash
  aws configure
  ```
  It will ask for the access key and secret key. Open the CSV file you downloaded earlier and copy the access key and secret key. Your AWS CLI should now be set up.

**Next, set up Docker:**

- Follow the installation instructions on the [Docker official website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-from-a-package).

- After successfully installing Docker with the latest build, run these commands:
  ```bash
  usermod -aG docker $USER  # Replace $USER with your username, e.g., 'ubuntu'
  newgrp docker
  sudo chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock
  which docker
  ```

**Next, set up Kubectl to install Kubernetes cluster:**

- Run this command:
  ```bash
  snap install kubectl --classic
  ```

**Next, set up Eksctl:**

Eksctl is a command-line tool used for managing Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) clusters.

- Run these commands to install Eksctl:
  ```bash
  curl --silent --location "https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_$(uname -s)_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp
  sudo mv /tmp/eksctl /usr/local/bin
  eksctl version
  ```
  
**Stage 2**: Build Frontend and Backend Images

**A. Set up Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**  
ECR is similar to Docker Hub, where we store Docker images.

- Go to your AWS console, search for ECR, and click on "Create repository" for the frontend. Set the visibility setting to public.
- In your terminal, navigate to the frontend directory and run the `ls` command.
- Go to your ECR repository and click on "View push commands."

**B. Build and Push the Frontend Image**

Run the following commands one by one to build the frontend image and push it to the ECR repository:

```bash
aws ecr-public get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin public.ecr.aws/l0l7e4u1
docker build -t 3-tier-frontend .
docker tag 3-tier-frontend:latest public.ecr.aws/l0l7e4u1/3-tier-frontend:latest
docker push public.ecr.aws/l0l7e4u1/3-tier-frontend:latest
```

**C. Run a Container from the Frontend Image**

1. List your Docker images to copy the image name:
   ```bash
   docker images
   ```

2. Run the frontend container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 3000:3000 3-tier-frontend:latest
   ```

*Note: Ensure port 3000 is allowed in your inbound rules in the NSG (Network Security Group).*

- You can now check if your frontend is set up and running by browsing to `public-ip:3000`. The application should be running on port 3000.

**Set Up Backend**

**A. Set Up the Backend**

1. Navigate to the backend directory.
2. Go to your ECR repository and click on "View push commands" for the backend repository.

![Alt text](image-1.png)

3. Run the following commands one by one in your terminal:

```bash
aws ecr-public get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin public.ecr.aws/l0l7e4u1
docker build -t 3-tier-backend .
docker tag 3-tier-backend:latest public.ecr.aws/l0l7e4u1/3-tier-backend:latest
docker push public.ecr.aws/l0l7e4u1/3-tier-backend:latest
```

Now your backend image is successfully built and pushed to the Elastic Container Registry, which will be used when creating the Elastic Kubernetes Service.

**Stage 3**: Configure Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, facilitating both declarative configuration and automation.

**Container Deployment Era**: Containers, similar to VMs but with more relaxed isolation properties, share the operating system (OS) among applications, making them lightweight. Like a VM, a container has its own filesystem, share of CPU, memory, process space, and more. Being decoupled from the underlying infrastructure, they are portable across clouds and OS distributions.

**Why You Need Kubernetes and What It Can Do**

Containers are excellent for bundling and running applications. In a production environment, managing these containers to ensure zero downtime is crucial. For example, if a container goes down, another container should start automatically. Kubernetes handles this behavior seamlessly.

**A. Set Up EKS Cluster**

1. Create an EKS cluster:
    ```bash
    eksctl create cluster --name three-tier-cluster --region us-east-1 --node-type t2.medium --nodes-min 2 --nodes-max 2
    aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-east-1 --name three-tier-cluster
    kubectl get nodes
    ```
    **Note**: It takes 15 to 20 minutes to create a cluster. You can monitor the creation process in AWS CloudFormation by searching for it in your AWS console.

2. Create a namespace:
    ```bash
    kubectl create namespace workshop
    kubectl config set-context --current --namespace workshop
    ```

**B. Create Deployment and Service for Frontend**

1. Go to the `k8s_manifests` directory and edit the `frontend-deployment.yaml` file.
2. Update the image name in `frontend-deployment.yaml`:
    - Go to your ECR repository, select the frontend repository, click on "View public listing," copy the image name, and paste it into the `frontend-deployment.yaml` file.
3. Create the deployment and service for the frontend:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f frontend-deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f frontend-service.yaml
    ```

**C. Create Deployment and Service for Backend**

1. In the same folder, edit the `backend-deployment.yaml` file.
2. Update the image name in `backend-deployment.yaml`:
    - Go to your ECR repository, select the backend repository, click on "View public listing," copy the image name, and paste it into the `backend-deployment.yaml` file.
3. Create the deployment and service for the backend:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f backend-deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f backend-service.yaml
    kubectl get pods -n workshop
    ```

**D. Set Up Database Tier**

1. Locate the `mongo` folder containing deployment, service, and secrets manifests.
2. Set up the database tier:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f .
    kubectl get all
    ```

Now that all three tiers (frontend, backend, and database) are ready, you need to set up an application load balancer to route external traffic to the cluster and an ingress for internal routing between the tiers.

**Stage 4**: Set Up Application Load Balancer and Ingress  



**A: Set Up AWS Load Balancer**

1. Fetch the IAM policy for your ALB:
    ```bash
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.5.4/docs/install/iam_policy.json
    ```

2. Create the IAM policy in your AWS account:
    ```bash
    aws iam create-policy --policy-name AWSLoadBalancerControllerIAMPolicy --policy-document file://iam_policy.json
    ```

3. Apply the load balancer policy to your EKS cluster:
    ```bash
    eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider --region=us-east-1 --cluster=three-tier-cluster --approve
    ```

4. Create and attach a service account to your cluster (replace `767397866747` with your AWS account number):
    ```bash
    eksctl create iamserviceaccount --cluster=three-tier-cluster --namespace=kube-system --name=aws-load-balancer-controller --role-name AmazonEKSLoadBalancerControllerRole --attach-policy-arn=arn:aws:iam::767397866747:policy/AWSLoadBalancerControllerIAMPolicy --approve --region=us-east-1
    ```

5. Install Helm (a tool for managing Kubernetes applications):
    ```bash
    sudo snap install helm --classic
    ```

6. Add the EKS repository using Helm:
    ```bash
    helm repo add eks https://aws.github.io/eks-charts
    ```

7. Update the EKS repository using Helm:
    ```bash
    helm repo update eks
    ```

8. Install the load balancer controller on your EKS cluster:
    ```bash
    helm install aws-load-balancer-controller eks/aws-load-balancer-controller -n kube-system --set clusterName=my-cluster --set serviceAccount.create=false --set serviceAccount.name=aws-load-balancer-controller
    kubectl get deployment -n kube-system aws-load-balancer-controller
    ```

Now your load balancer is set up. Let's set up Ingress for internal routing.

**Step 2: Set Up Ingress for Internal Routing**

1. Locate the `full_stack_lb.yaml` file.
2. Apply the Ingress configuration:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f full_stack_lb.yaml
    kubectl get ing -n workshop
    ```

3. Go to your web browser and paste the DNS address provided.

Congratulations! Your application is now accessible through the load balancer and ingress.

**Stage 5**: Tear Down the Infrastructure

1. In your current folder, run the following command to delete all resources:
    ```bash
    kubectl delete -f .
    ```

2. Navigate to the `mongo` folder and delete the database tier:
    ```bash
    kubectl delete -f .
    ```

3. Delete the EKS cluster and the CloudFormation stack:
    ```bash
    eksctl delete cluster --name three-tier-cluster --region us-east-1
    aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name eksctl-three-tier-cluster-cluster
    ```

4. You can check all the changes in the CloudFormation console of AWS.
